## Folder Structure
- **/src**: Folder for the main code.
- **/test**: Folder for the test code.

## How It Works
User will be sent to the home screen when they start the app, where they get to choose if they want to play the game or exit from the app. If user choose to play the game, they will prompt to enter player 1's and player 2's name. Then each player will put the 4 battleships based on the inputted coordinate and position. After that, they will start the battleship game based on the classic battleship rules.
